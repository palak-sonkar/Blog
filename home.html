                        One of the things I love most about California is that the roads themselves can be just as exciting as the destinations. Of course, there are famous roads like Pacific Coast Highway in the state, but we also have a lot of great drives that are not as well known to travel on. Here is a list of my favorite California drives, along with the posts that I have written about places that can be found on that drive.

                        One of the things I love most about California is that the roads themselves can be just as exciting as the destinations. Of course, there are famous roads like Pacific Coast Highway in the state, but we also have a lot of great drives that are not as well known to travel on. Here is a list of my favorite California drives, along with the posts that I have written about places that can be found on that drive.
